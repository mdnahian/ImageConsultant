# import the merged data set

# produce a couple of random user profiles

# produce a composite profile of reddit

# measure/graph trait correlations with each measure of popularity (the green line is drawn manually!)

# to point out scientific interest of our project, we want to compare trait prevalence with trait popularity

# most importantly, regression techniques for likeability assessment

# once you choose a regression, 
# store a coefficient vector,
write.table(coefficients(results), 'coefficients.txt', sep="\t")

# store a like prediction data frame,
write.csv()
# verify the model,
# visualize its effectiveness,
