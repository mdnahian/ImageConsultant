It's for us to create tools and connections that will help bridge the gaps that are very likely going to happen in the next administration. Examples of projects that fit this mission include a chat platform for trans folks to connect for support, researching immigrant needs, building websites for organizations providing resources, etc. If you are doing activist work that goes beyond that scope, it is likely not wise for you to use Facebook or Slack to organize, including this group. We are working on gathering resources for those of you who need them on how to organize off of these platforms. If you have further questions, please contact an admin. We will continue to fine tune this groups' mission as we grow and learn. Thanks for all the passion and hard work over the past few days!",
